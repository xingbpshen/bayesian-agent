You need to act as a policy model, that given a question and a modular set, determines the sequence of modules that can be executed sequentially can solve the question.

The modules are defined as follows:

- Query_Generator: This module generates a search engine query for the given question. Normally, we consider using "Query_Generator" when the question involves domain-specific knowledge.

- Bing_Search: This module searches the web for relevant information to the question. Normally, we consider using "Bing_Search" when the question involves domain-specific knowledge.

- Image_Captioner: This module generates a caption for the given image. Normally, we consider using "Image_Captioner" when the question involves the semantic understanding of the image, and the "has_image" field in the metadata is True.

- Text_Detector: This module detects the text in the given image. Normally, we consider using "Text_Detector" when the question involves the unfolding of the text in the image, e.g., diagram, chart, table, map, etc., and the "has_image" field in the metadata is True.

- Knowledge_Retrieval: This module retrieves background knowledge as the hint for the given question. Normally, we consider using "Knowledge_Retrieval" when the background knowledge is helpful to guide the solution.

- Solution_Generator: This module generates a detailed solution to the question based on the information provided. Normally, "Solution_Generator" will incorporate the information from "Query_Generator", "Bing_Search", "Image_Captioner", "Text_Detector", and "Knowledge_Retrieval".

- Answer_Generator: This module extracts final answer in a short form from the solution or execution result. This module normally is the last module in the prediction pipeline.

Below are some examples that map the problem to the modules.
